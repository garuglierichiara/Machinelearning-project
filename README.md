# Machinelearning-project
Developed and evaluated two machine learning models – a fine-tuned RoBERTa and a custom CNN – for multi- label text classification on the TinyStories dataset. The project focused on predicting six distinct story tags and analyzed model performance, particularly for challenging abstract tags like 'Conflict' and 'Foreshadowing'.
