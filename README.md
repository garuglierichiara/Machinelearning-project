# Multi-label Story Tag Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Multi-label Text Classification** using the TinyStories dataset. The goal is to predict distinct story tags (such as 'Conflict', 'Foreshadowing', etc.) based on the text content.

## Methods
I developed and compared two different Machine Learning models:
1. **Fine-tuned RoBERTa:** A transformer-based model optimized for this specific task.
2. **Custom CNN:** A Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch for text classification.

## Key Results
The project analyzes the performance of both models, with a specific focus on their ability to detect abstract concepts within the stories.

## Tools Used
* Python
* PyTorch / TensorFlow (scegli quello che hai usato)
* Pandas & NumPy

## Dataset & Model Weights
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the trained model weights and the specific dataset used for this project are hosted externally.
